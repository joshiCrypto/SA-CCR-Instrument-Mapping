    "**Introduction:<br>**\n",
    "This notebook contains the methods for calculating the effective notional of transactions and MtM as defined in the SA CCR methodology for the determination of counterparty credit risk capital requirements. SA CCR was introduced in 2014 and phased in by January 2017 as part of the Basel III framework. It replaced Basel I Current Exposure Method (CEM) and Basels II Standardized Method (SM).<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "At a high level interpretation, the SA CCR methodology can be broken down into the following steps :\n",
    "- A top down allocation of instruments to corresponding {Asset Class x Hedging Set x Bucket} category:\n",
    "    - Netting set -> Asset Class -> Hedging Set -> Bucket -> instrument\n",
    "- Mapping of instruments to the parameters required to calculate the Effective Notional of the instrument (more or less delta sensitity to underlying RF):\n",
    "    -  instrument -> instrument parameters -> Effective Notional of transaction\n",
    "- A bottom up aggregation of instrument Effective Notionals to obtain the netting set EAD:\n",
    "    - Effective Notional of instrument -> Bucket -> Hedging Set -> Asset Class -> Netting set\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This Notebook concerns itself with the second step: mapping instruments into the parameters required for aggreation. A separate notebook will implement the top down allocation (step 1) and the bottom up aggregation (step 3) of a portfolio of instruments. \n",
